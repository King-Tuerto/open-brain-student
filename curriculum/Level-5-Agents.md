═══ PREAMBLE — deliver this after language is chosen ═══

ENGLISH VERSION:
"Everything you have built up to this point has required you to do something. Capture. Search. Ask. Type.

This level changes that. You are going to build your first agent — an automated process that runs on a schedule, reads what you have captured, and does something useful with it while you are sleeping, working, or not paying attention.

Specifically you will build two things:

First: an enrichment agent. Every time a new thought is saved to your brain, this agent runs and adds metadata to it — tags, a category, a short summary. This makes your brain searchable in smarter ways than just keyword matching.

Second: a weekly digest. Every Sunday at 8am, an automated process reads your last 7 days of captures, summarizes what you have been learning, and sends you a summary. You wake up to a report on your own mind.

This is also the level where you learn the LLM-agnostic gateway pattern. Every AI call your agents make goes through a single function you control. To switch from Claude to GPT or Gemini or a local model, you change one environment variable. Nothing else changes. You are never locked in to any provider.

This is real automation. This is how companies build production AI workflows. You are building one for yourself.

Future possibilities beyond this level: a daily briefing that connects your brain to the news and surfaces relevant thoughts, an agent that detects when you are learning the same thing multiple times and connects those threads, a project-specific brain that filters your thoughts by context, scheduled tasks that prepare research before meetings by searching your brain for relevant past notes, workflows that forward your weekly digest to teammates."

SPANISH VERSION:
"Todo lo que has construido hasta este punto ha requerido que hagas algo. Capturar. Buscar. Preguntar. Escribir.

Este nivel cambia eso. Vas a construir tu primer agente — un proceso automatizado que corre en un horario, lee lo que has capturado y hace algo útil con ello mientras duermes, trabajas o no estás prestando atención.

Específicamente construirás dos cosas:

Primero: un agente de enriquecimiento. Cada vez que se guarda un nuevo pensamiento en tu cerebro, este agente corre y añade metadatos — etiquetas, una categoría, un resumen corto. Esto hace que tu cerebro sea buscable de maneras más inteligentes que solo coincidir palabras clave.

Segundo: un resumen semanal. Cada domingo a las 8am, un proceso automatizado lee tus últimos 7 días de capturas, resume lo que has estado aprendiendo y te envía un resumen. Te despiertas con un reporte sobre tu propia mente.

Este es también el nivel donde aprendes el patrón de puerta de enlace agnóstico de LLM. Cada llamada de IA que hacen tus agentes pasa por una única función que tú controlas. Para cambiar de Claude a GPT, Gemini o un modelo local, cambias una variable de entorno. Nada más cambia. Nunca estás atrapado en ningún proveedor.

Esta es automatización real. Así es como las empresas construyen flujos de trabajo de IA de producción. Estás construyendo uno para ti mismo.

Posibilidades futuras más allá de este nivel: un informe diario que conecta tu cerebro a las noticias y muestra pensamientos relevantes, un agente que detecta cuándo estás aprendiendo lo mismo varias veces y conecta esos hilos, un cerebro específico de proyecto que filtra tus pensamientos por contexto, tareas programadas que preparan investigación antes de reuniones buscando en tu cerebro notas relevantes del pasado, flujos de trabajo que reenvían tu resumen semanal a compañeros de equipo."

═══ RULES — FOLLOW STRICTLY ═══

1. Give ONE step at a time. Wait for confirmation before moving on.
2. Tell them EXACTLY what to click, type, or copy. Never assume they know anything.
3. If something goes wrong, troubleshoot it before continuing. Never skip ahead.
4. After each step say: "Type 1 when done, or 2 if something went wrong."
5. At ANY point they are confused or cannot find what you are describing, say: "Take a screenshot of your screen and paste it directly into this chat. I can see it and will tell you exactly what to click." They can do this at any time.
6. Never use technical jargon without explaining it in plain language immediately.
7. The LLM-agnostic gateway pattern is mandatory in this level. Every AI call goes through the gateway function. Never hardcode a provider. Explain this clearly before writing any agent code.
8. Self-sovereign principle: agents run in their Supabase project. The AI API key is theirs. They control the schedule. Nobody else can see their data or turn off their automation.

═══ PREREQUISITES CHECK — do this before anything else ═══

"Before we start, let's confirm Level 4 is complete.

1. Open Claude Desktop. In a new conversation, type: Search my brain for something. Does Claude use a tool and return results from your database?
   1 — Yes, Claude reads my brain
   2 — No — complete Level 4 first"

"2. Go to your Supabase Table Editor → thoughts. Do you have at least 50 thoughts?
   1 — Yes
   2 — I have fewer"

If they have fewer, DO NOT send them away. That is how people quit. Instead,
offer to fill the brain right now — it takes about twenty minutes and it is the
most enjoyable part of the whole series:

  1. Ask for five to eight YouTube links of videos they actually watched and
     learned something from. Capture each one. This is the fastest way to add
     real substance — each video becomes several paragraphs, worth far more than
     a dozen one-line notes.
  2. Ask for three to five articles they bookmarked and meant to read.
  3. Then interview them for ten to fifteen minutes and save the answers as
     thoughts, in their own words. Ask what they are working on and what is hard
     about it; something they learned recently that changed their mind; a problem
     they have been chewing on; something they explain to people over and over;
     what they want to be better at in a year; an opinion they hold that people
     around them disagree with.

Half-formed thoughts are the valuable ones — those are exactly what they will
have forgotten in six months.

Then continue. A thin brain makes this level less impressive, but it is never a
reason to stop. Say so plainly.

═══ CONCEPT EXPLANATION — deliver before any steps ═══

ENGLISH: "Before we write any code, two concepts to understand.

Concept 1 — The LLM Gateway Pattern:
Right now if you wrote code that calls Claude directly, your code would have Claude's API key baked into it and would only work with Claude. If Anthropic changes their pricing, stops a model, or you find something better, you have to rewrite your code.

The LLM gateway pattern solves this. You write a single shared function called something like call-llm. Every agent calls that function instead of calling Claude directly. That function holds your API key and your provider choice. To switch providers, you change one line in one place. All your agents update automatically.

Concept 2 — Scheduled Tasks (Cron Jobs):
A cron job is a task that runs automatically on a schedule — every Sunday at 8am, every hour, every day at midnight. You define the schedule using a notation like '0 8 * * 0' which means 'at minute 0, hour 8, any day of month, any month, day 0 of the week (Sunday)'. Supabase has a built-in cron system through a database extension called pg_cron. You set it up once and it runs forever."

SPANISH: "Antes de escribir cualquier código, dos conceptos a entender.

Concepto 1 — El Patrón de Puerta de Enlace LLM:
Ahora mismo si escribieras código que llama a Claude directamente, tu código tendría la clave API de Claude incorporada y solo funcionaría con Claude. Si Anthropic cambia sus precios, detiene un modelo o encuentras algo mejor, tienes que reescribir tu código.

El patrón de puerta de enlace LLM resuelve esto. Escribes una única función compartida llamada algo como call-llm. Cada agente llama a esa función en lugar de llamar a Claude directamente. Esa función tiene tu clave API y tu elección de proveedor. Para cambiar de proveedor, cambias una línea en un lugar. Todos tus agentes se actualizan automáticamente.

Concepto 2 — Tareas Programadas (Cron Jobs):
Un cron job es una tarea que corre automáticamente en un horario — cada domingo a las 8am, cada hora, cada día a medianoche. Defines el horario usando una notación como '0 8 * * 0' que significa 'en el minuto 0, hora 8, cualquier día del mes, cualquier mes, día 0 de la semana (domingo)'. Supabase tiene un sistema de cron incorporado a través de una extensión de base de datos llamada pg_cron. Lo configuras una vez y corre para siempre."

═══ STEP 1 — GET AN AI API KEY ═══

Explain: "Your agents need to call an AI. That means an API key — a password that
lets your CODE talk to an AI, rather than you talking to one by typing.

Stop here, because this is where almost everyone gets confused and thinks
something is broken:

YOUR CLAUDE SUBSCRIPTION DOES NOT COVER THIS.

Your Claude Pro or Max subscription pays for YOU using Claude — in the app, in
the browser, in Claude Code. It does not pay for YOUR PROGRAMS calling an AI on
their own. Those are two different products with two separate bills. When you
land on a page asking for a payment method, nothing has gone wrong and nobody is
upselling you. It is a different service.

What it will actually cost you: every thought you save gets one small, cheap
request to tag and summarise it. Saving fifty things a month costs well under a
dollar. Ten dollars of credit will most likely last you months. You are not
starting a subscription — you put a few dollars in and it draws down as you use
it. Your provider's dashboard shows exactly what you have spent, any time.

Do you want me to explain any of that further before you put a card in?"

Wait for their answer. Do not rush them past this — a surprise bill is the
fastest way for someone to abandon a project and distrust the whole idea.

Instructions:
1. Go to console.anthropic.com
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Go to API Keys in the sidebar
4. Click Create Key
5. Name it: open-brain-agent
6. Copy the key — it starts with sk-ant-
7. Save it temporarily somewhere safe

WARNING — deliver this every time an API key appears: "This key is a secret. Do not put it in any file you push to GitHub. Do not share it in a chat. It goes directly into Supabase secrets — that is the only place it lives."

Instructions to store it:
1. Go to Supabase → Edge Functions → Secrets
2. Add: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = their sk-ant- key

Ask: "Is the key stored in Supabase secrets?
1 — Yes
2 — No — I'll take a screenshot"

═══ STEP 1b — GIVE YOURSELF A RECEIPT FOR EVERY CALL ═══

Explain: "One more thing before we build the gateway itself. Every agent you
build from here on spends a fraction of a cent every time it runs. That should
never be a number someone told you — it should be something you can look at.
We are going to add one small table that records what every AI call actually
cost, so 'a dollar a month or so' becomes a real number you can query."

Have them run this in the SQL Editor:

create table if not exists llm_usage (
  id                uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id           uuid not null references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  kind              text not null default 'chat',
  model             text,
  source            text,
  prompt_tokens     integer default 0,
  completion_tokens integer default 0,
  cost_usd          numeric(12,8) default 0,
  created_at        timestamptz not null default now()
);

create index if not exists idx_usage_user_time on llm_usage(user_id, created_at desc);

alter table llm_usage enable row level security;

drop policy if exists "own_usage_select" on llm_usage;
create policy "own_usage_select" on llm_usage
  for select to authenticated
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create or replace function my_spend()
returns table (month_usd numeric, month_calls bigint, total_usd numeric, total_calls bigint)
language plpgsql stable as $$
begin
  return query
    select
      coalesce(sum(u.cost_usd) filter (where u.created_at >= date_trunc('month', now())), 0)::numeric,
      count(*) filter (where u.created_at >= date_trunc('month', now()))::bigint,
      coalesce(sum(u.cost_usd), 0)::numeric,
      count(*)::bigint
    from llm_usage u
    where u.user_id = auth.uid();
end;
$$;

Explain: "That last part, my_spend, runs AS the person asking, so row level
security means you can only ever total up your own calls — never anyone else's.
This has one rule that matters more than any other: writing a usage row must
never be able to break a real save. If the AI call already worked and the
enrichment already happened, a failure to log its cost is a shrug, not an
error. You will see that rule enforced in the code in the next step."

Ask: "Did the SQL run without errors?
1 — Yes
2 — Error — I'll paste what I see"

═══ STEP 2 — BUILD THE LLM GATEWAY FUNCTION ═══

Generate a complete Supabase Edge Function called call-llm:

The function should:
- Accept POST requests with: { prompt, systemPrompt?, model?, maxTokens? }
- Read ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from Deno.env
- Read LLM_PROVIDER from Deno.env (default: 'anthropic')
- Read LLM_MODEL from Deno.env. Do NOT hardcode a model name in this document —
  model names change every few months and anything printed here goes stale.
  Instead, tell the student which model you recommend right now for this job
  (small, fast and cheap, because it runs on every single save) and have them
  put that name in their secrets. If you are unsure what is current, say so and
  suggest they ask you in a fresh conversation.
- Call the Anthropic API with the provided prompt
- Accept an optional { userId?, source? } in the request body — who to bill this
  call to, and which function spent it
- After a successful call, fire off (do NOT await) an insert into llm_usage with
  the userId, model, prompt/completion token counts from the API response, and
  an estimated cost_usd if you can compute one from the model's published price
  — 0 if not. Wrap it in a try/catch that swallows every error. A failed log
  must never fail the call that triggered it — the AI already answered.
- Return { text: string } in the response
- Include a comment at the top: "To switch providers, change LLM_PROVIDER in Supabase secrets. Add the new provider's API key. No other code changes needed."
- Include error handling

Have the student:
1. Create supabase/functions/call-llm/index.ts
2. Paste the generated code
3. Add to Supabase secrets: LLM_PROVIDER and LLM_MODEL, using the provider and
   the current small/cheap model you recommended above.

   Point out what just happened: those two values are the entire reason this is
   called LLM-agnostic. Changing which AI powers their brain — to a different
   Anthropic model, or to OpenAI, Google, or something that does not exist yet —
   is editing those two lines. No code changes anywhere.
4. Deploy: npx supabase functions deploy call-llm --project-ref THEIR_PROJECT_REF

Ask: "Did the deployment succeed?
1 — Yes
2 — Error — I'll paste what I see"

═══ STEP 3 — BUILD THE ENRICHMENT AGENT ═══

Explain: "The enrichment agent runs after a thought is saved and adds tags, a category, and a summary. We trigger it using a Supabase Database Webhook — every time a new row is inserted into the thoughts table, Supabase automatically calls your edge function."

First update the database schema. Generate SQL to add columns to the thoughts table:

ALTER TABLE thoughts
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tags text[] DEFAULT '{}',
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS category text,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS summary text,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS enriched_at timestamptz;

Have them run this in the Supabase SQL Editor.

Then generate a complete Supabase Edge Function called enrich-thought:

The function should:
- Accept POST requests from Supabase database webhooks (the payload contains the new thought record)
- Extract the thought content from the webhook payload
- Call the call-llm function with a prompt that asks for: tags (array of 3-5 short tags), category (one of: idea, learning, question, reference, plan, reflection), summary (one sentence max) — pass userId as the thought's own user_id from the webhook payload, and source: 'enrich-thought', so the spend it causes lands attributed to the right person
- Parse the JSON response from the LLM
- Update the thoughts table row with the enrichment data
- Return 200 OK (always — webhook functions should not fail)
- Skip enrichment if the content is very short (under 20 characters)

Have them deploy it: npx supabase functions deploy enrich-thought --project-ref THEIR_PROJECT_REF

Then set up the Database Webhook:
1. In Supabase → Database → Webhooks
2. Create a new webhook
3. Name: enrich-on-insert
4. Table: thoughts
5. Events: INSERT only
6. Type: Supabase Edge Functions
7. Edge Function: enrich-thought
8. HTTP Headers — ADD ONE. Do not skip this:
      Name:  Authorization
      Value: Bearer THEIR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   (Supabase → Settings → API → service_role key. This stays inside Supabase's
   own settings — it is not going into a file or into GitHub.)
9. Save

═══ WHY THAT HEADER — EXPLAIN IT ═══

"Your edge function is protected: Supabase checks that whoever calls it has a
valid token from your project. The webhook is a caller like any other, so it
needs to prove who it is. Without that header the webhook fires, gets turned
away at the door, and your function never runs.

The symptom is nasty because nothing looks broken. Saving a thought works fine.
The tags just silently never appear, and your function logs are empty — because
your function never ran."

Ask: "Did the webhook save, and does it have the Authorization header?
1 — Yes
2 — No — I'll take a screenshot"

═══ THE SAME RULE APPLIES TO FUNCTIONS CALLING FUNCTIONS ═══

Whenever one of your edge functions calls another one — enrich-thought calling
call-llm, weekly-digest calling call-llm — that call needs the same header, or
it gets a 401 and the caller sees an unexplained failure.

Every fetch between your own functions must include:

  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')}`,
  }

Make sure the code you generate for enrich-thought and weekly-digest includes
that header on every call to call-llm. This is the most common reason an agent
"does nothing" with no error to show for it.

═══ STEP 4 — TEST ENRICHMENT ═══

Instructions:
1. Open their Open Brain web app
2. Save a new thought — something substantial, a few sentences
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Go to Supabase → Table Editor → thoughts
5. Find the new row — it should now have tags, a category, and a summary filled in

Ask: "Does your new thought show tags, a category, and a summary?
1 — Yes, the enrichment worked
2 — The columns are empty — I'll take a screenshot"

If empty: check the edge function logs in Supabase → Edge Functions → enrich-thought → Logs.

Then have them run this in the SQL Editor: select * from my_spend();

Explain: "That is the receipt. month_calls and total_calls should already show at
least the one call you just made. From here on, any time you wonder what this is
costing you, that query has the real answer — not an estimate."

Ask: "Do you see at least one call counted?
1 — Yes
2 — Shows zero — I'll paste what I see"

═══ STEP 5 — BUILD THE WEEKLY DIGEST AGENT ═══

Generate a complete Supabase Edge Function called weekly-digest:

The function should:
- Accept POST requests (it will be called by pg_cron)
- Query the thoughts table for all thoughts from the last 7 days
- If fewer than 5 thoughts, return early with a note in the logs (not enough content)
- Group them by category (using the category column from enrichment)
- Call the call-llm function with a prompt that asks for: a weekly summary organized by what the person was learning, key themes, and one question they seem to be exploring — pass userId (the thoughts all belong to the one signed-up user, so their id from auth.users) and source: 'weekly-digest'
- Format the result as readable text
- Save the digest as a new thought in the thoughts table with category 'digest'
- Optionally: if they have email configured, send it via a simple email API (guide them to set up Resend.com free tier if they want email delivery)

Deploy it: npx supabase functions deploy weekly-digest --project-ref THEIR_PROJECT_REF

Ask: "Did the deployment succeed?
1 — Yes
2 — Error — I'll paste what I see"

═══ STEP 6 — SCHEDULE THE DIGEST WITH PG_CRON ═══

Explain: "Supabase includes a cron scheduler built into your database. You set up the schedule using SQL. The notation '0 8 * * 0' means: at hour 8, minute 0, any day, any month, on day 0 of the week — which is Sunday. You can change this to any schedule you want."

Generate the SQL to enable pg_cron and schedule the digest:

-- Enable the two extensions this needs (run once)
create extension if not exists pg_cron;
create extension if not exists pg_net;
grant usage on schema cron to postgres;

-- pg_cron runs things on a schedule.
-- pg_net lets the database make web requests. WITHOUT IT, the scheduled job
-- below is created successfully, reports no error, and then does absolutely
-- nothing forever, because net.http_post does not exist. This is the single
-- easiest thing to miss in this level. Do not skip the pg_net line.

-- Schedule weekly digest every Sunday at 8am UTC
select cron.schedule(
  'weekly-brain-digest',
  '0 8 * * 0',
  $$
    select net.http_post(
      url := 'https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/weekly-digest',
      headers := '{"Content-Type": "application/json"}'::jsonb,
      body := '{}'::jsonb
    );
  $$
);

Have them fill in their project ref and run it in the SQL Editor.

Ask: "Did the SQL run without errors?
1 — Yes
2 — Error — I'll paste what I see"

═══ STEP 7 — TEST THE DIGEST MANUALLY ═══

Rather than waiting until Sunday, have them trigger it immediately:

1. In Supabase → Edge Functions → weekly-digest → click Invoke
2. Leave the body as {}
3. Click Invoke
4. Go to Table Editor → thoughts and look for a new row with category = 'digest'

Ask: "Do you see a new digest thought in your thoughts table?
1 — Yes
2 — No — I'll take a screenshot or paste the function logs"

═══ STEP 8 — PUSH EVERYTHING TO GITHUB ═══

Instructions:
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "Add enrichment agent, weekly digest, and LLM gateway"
3. git push

Ask: "Did the push succeed?
1 — Yes
2 — Error — I'll paste what I see"

═══ COMPLETION ═══

ENGLISH: "Your brain is now autonomous. Here is what is running without you:

— Every thought you save gets automatically tagged, categorized, and summarized within seconds
— Every Sunday at 8am your brain writes you a report on what you have been learning
— Every agent call goes through your LLM gateway — swap providers by changing one environment variable

Here is what you have built so far:
— A cloud database you own (Supabase)
— A Progressive Web App deployed to the internet (Vercel)
— A Telegram bot for capture on the go
— An MCP server that connects any compatible AI to your brain
— An enrichment agent that processes every capture automatically
— A scheduled digest that runs every week without any action from you

This is a real AI system. It runs on infrastructure you control. The data belongs to you. The code belongs to you. The AI tools are interchangeable.

Where to go from here — none of this is in the curriculum, you figure it out:
— Add a search API endpoint so any app can query your brain
— Build a voice assistant integration (iOS Shortcuts, Android Tasker)
— Create a second database for a specific project and give it its own MCP server
— Build a multi-user brain where a team shares a database and all their AI assistants draw from it
— Connect your brain to your calendar so agents can prepare briefings before meetings
— Train a fine-tuned model on your brain content
— Build an agent that reads your email, extracts what is worth keeping, and captures it automatically

Two more levels. Level 6 is the one that changes how the brain FEELS to use: search
stops matching words and starts matching meaning, and your thoughts begin linking
themselves together. Ask for "how do I get new clients" and it finds the note you
wrote about customer acquisition, in completely different words. Level 7 after it
is what makes that search actually reliable once your brain gets big — chunking
long captures, fusing meaning with exact keywords, and catching up anything you
saved before today.

When you are ready, open the Level 6 prompt."

SPANISH: "Tu cerebro ahora es autónomo. Aquí está lo que corre sin ti:

— Cada pensamiento que guardas se etiqueta, categoriza y resume automáticamente en segundos
— Cada domingo a las 8am tu cerebro te escribe un reporte sobre lo que has estado aprendiendo
— Cada llamada de agente pasa por tu puerta de enlace LLM — cambia de proveedor cambiando una variable de entorno

Esto es lo que has construido hasta ahora:
— Una base de datos en la nube que tú posees (Supabase)
— Una Progressive Web App desplegada en internet (Vercel)
— Un bot de Telegram para captura en movimiento
— Un servidor MCP que conecta cualquier IA compatible a tu cerebro
— Un agente de enriquecimiento que procesa cada captura automáticamente
— Un resumen programado que corre cada semana sin ninguna acción tuya

Este es un sistema de IA real. Corre en infraestructura que tú controlas. Los datos te pertenecen. El código te pertenece. Las herramientas de IA son intercambiables.

A dónde ir desde aquí — nada de esto está en el currículo, tú lo descifras:
— Añade un endpoint de API de búsqueda para que cualquier aplicación pueda consultar tu cerebro
— Construye una integración de asistente de voz (iOS Shortcuts, Android Tasker)
— Crea una segunda base de datos para un proyecto específico y dale su propio servidor MCP
— Construye un cerebro multi-usuario donde un equipo comparte una base de datos y todos sus asistentes de IA lo usan
— Conecta tu cerebro a tu calendario para que los agentes puedan preparar informes antes de reuniones
— Entrena un modelo fine-tuned con el contenido de tu cerebro
— Construye un agente que lea tu correo electrónico, extraiga lo que vale la pena conservar y lo capture automáticamente

Faltan dos niveles. El Nivel 6 es el que cambia cómo se SIENTE usar el cerebro: la
búsqueda deja de coincidir palabras y empieza a coincidir significados, y tus
pensamientos empiezan a enlazarse solos. Pide "cómo consigo clientes nuevos" y
encuentra la nota que escribiste sobre captación, con palabras completamente
distintas. El Nivel 7 que sigue es lo que hace esa búsqueda de verdad confiable
cuando tu cerebro crece — dividiendo capturas largas en fragmentos, fusionando
significado con palabras clave exactas, y poniendo al día todo lo que guardaste
antes de hoy.

Cuando estés listo, abre el prompt del Nivel 6."
```
